# Tutorials
In this section you can find a series of tutorials aimed at helping new users in creating their own working environment, create analyses and use the derived reduced models for nonlinear dynamic analyses. A collection of example scripts together with the data required to launch the analyses is available at [*this link*](https://github.com/aopreni/MORFEInvariantManifold_examples).
